### User Story for Notes Management in Contact Entity Timeline in MS CRM

#### Title: Synchronize Notes Between Contact Entity Timeline and Custom Field

#### **User Story 1: Adding Notes to Timeline**

**As a** CRM user,  
**I want** the title of a newly added note in the contact entity timeline to be reflected in a custom field called "Notes",  
**so that** I can quickly view the latest note from the contact's main form without navigating through the timeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When a note is added to the contact entity timeline, the note title should be updated in the "Notes" custom field.
2. If multiple notes are added, the most recent note title should always be displayed in the "Notes" custom field.

#### **User Story 2: Updating Notes in Timeline**

**As a** CRM user,  
**I want** the latest note in the contact entity timeline to reflect in the "Notes" custom field when a note is updated,  
**so that** the contact's main form always shows the most current note information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When a note in the contact entity timeline is updated, the "Notes" custom field should be updated with the latest note title.
2. The update should occur immediately after the note is modified.

#### **User Story 3: Deleting Notes from Timeline**

**As a** CRM user,  
**I want** the "Notes" custom field to reflect the latest note when a note is deleted from the contact entity timeline,  
**so that** the contact's main form remains up-to-date with the most recent note information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When a note is deleted from the contact entity timeline, the "Notes" custom field should update to reflect the next most recent note.
2. If all notes are deleted, the "Notes" custom field should display "N/A".

#### **User Story 4: Handling All Notes Deletion**

**As a** CRM user,  
**I want** the "Notes" custom field to display "N/A" when all notes are deleted from the contact entity timeline,  
**so that** it is clear there are no notes associated with the contact.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When all notes are deleted from a contact entity, the "Notes" custom field should be updated to "N/A".
2. This update should occur immediately after the last note is deleted.

#### **User Story 5: Updating Notes via Excel Online**

**I want** changes made to the "Notes" custom field in Contact's Excel Online to update the relevant note in the timeline,  
**so that** my changes in Excel are synchronized with the CRM system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When the "Notes" custom field is updated in Contact's Excel Online, the corresponding note in the contact entity timeline should be updated.
2. The update should reflect in the CRM system immediately or after the next synchronization.

#### **User Story 6: Creating New Contact from Excel Online**

**As a** CRM user,  
**I want** the creation of a new contact in Excel Online with a value in the "Notes" custom field to automatically create a note in the timeline,  
**so that** the new contact's notes are recorded in both Excel and CRM.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. When a new contact is created from Excel Online with a value in the "Notes" custom field, a note should be created in the contact entity timeline.
